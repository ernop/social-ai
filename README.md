social ai image generation

** How it works

# this code sets up a discord bot

* everyone generates images in a channel
* the bot monitors the channel
* the bot downloads and annotates them with the prompt (images work much better w/prompt)
* bot puts them in a folder
* run slideshow software on the folder to continuously cycle through
* there are also commands to clear out older images.
